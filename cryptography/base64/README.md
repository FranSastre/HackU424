# üîê Base64 Encoding Challenge - Learn the Difference!

In this challenge, you'll be given multiple **Base64 encoded strings**. Your task is to decode them to reveal the hidden message. üßê But remember: **encoding is not encryption**!

Many people mistakenly believe that encoding and encryption are the same thing, but they aren't. This challenge is here to help you understand the difference!

## üìã Requirements

No special tools are required for this challenge, but you'll need a Base64 decoder. Here are a few options:

1. Use an **online Base64 decoder** (simply search "Base64 decode" in your browser).
2. Use a **command-line tool** like `base64` if you're on Linux/Mac:
   ```
   echo "your_base64_string" | base64 --decode
   ```
3. Use **Python** to decode Base64:
   ```
   python -c "import base64; print(base64.b64decode('your_base64_string').decode('utf-8'))"
   ```

## üöÄ Instructions

1. **Understand the Difference**  
   Encoding is the process of converting data into a different format using a scheme that is publicly available. It's not meant to protect the data, just to represent it in a different form, like Base64. üß©

   Encryption, on the other hand, is the process of transforming data into an unreadable format using a secret key. Without the key, you can't decrypt it.

2. **Decode the Base64 String**  
   Below, you'll find a Base64 encoded string. Use your decoder of choice to reveal the hidden message.

   Here's an example Base64 encoded string:
   ```
   U29sdmluZyBiYXNlNjQgaXMgc29ydGEgbGlrZSB1bnJhdmVsaW5nIGEgY29kZSB0byBtYWtlIGl0IHJlYWQh
   ```

   After decoding it, the output will be:
   ```
    Solving base64 is sorta like unraveling a code to make it read!
    ```


3. **Decode the Challenge Strings**  

In the challenge, you'll be given several Base64 strings that look like the one above. You need to decode them all to find the flag hidden inside one of the strings. üéØ

Keep decoding these until you find the flag! üèÅ

## üîß Notes

- **Remember**: Encoding is **not** encryption. You don‚Äôt need any special keys or passwords to decode Base64‚Äîjust a decoder.

# Good luck, and happy decoding! üéâ
